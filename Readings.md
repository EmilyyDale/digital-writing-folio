### Electronic Literature: What is it? 

### Tarako Gorge 

Is a kenetic poem. And can be defined as a poem due to the structural integrity and word content. However, it differs from traditional poetry because as it is infinite in its length and the flow is decided by the algorythm in the code. It is harder to analyse this poem due to its infinite length and the fact that it has a multitude of different readings. 

### The Gathering Cloud

Trying to defy the lines of poetry - very experimental. Highlights space and form over words. Confuses my understanding of poetry as it focuses on movement, graphics and visual elements to portray meaning in a more powerful way them the word aspect of the piece. However, meaning can also be derived from other elements - how then does this piece fit into the category of poetry? And what are the peramaters of digital poetry?
