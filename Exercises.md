### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

- creative nonfiction pieces 
- landscape poetry 
- prose poetry 
- profile pieces and articles
- personal essays 
- fictional short stories 

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write? 
I use my laptop mostly but a pen and paper or notes. A calm environment. Which for me includes a tea, a comfortable, light filled space and greenery. I find I am more creative and focused when writing outside under the sky. However, this is limiting becasue of the weather (especially in Melbourne) so I make do with my kitchen table as it is the room that gets the most sun in the house. If writing on the couch which I tend to do a lot, I like a cushion under my laptop and often I play soft instrumental music as a type of white noise element. I tend to write nonsensical dribble for the first paragraph which actually helps me get into the 'zone'. I centre it around the topic I'm focusing on that day. If I'm finding it difficult to get started, I use the pomodoro method to aid in transitioning into that flow state.

### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
The tools I use are more habitual than anything else and help me perosnally get into a flow state. However, I'm not under the impression I have the best process and think I could benefit from exploring other options. 

### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)? 
They help my writing practice as they aid in making me feel comfortable and open up my mind to creative epxression. However that is also in itself a constraint as if they enviroment isn't perfect I can use it as an excuse not to write and feel uncomfortable. However, I think that a lot of it is phsycosomatic and that my writing practice would flourish if I was pushed to write in numerous differnt conditions and circumstances. In relation to digital writing my practice is very physical and analog even when I'm using a laptop. I'm not a confident tech or technological tool user. Which is why this course could aid in the development of new skills and directions in my writing practice.
