### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

- creative nonfiction pieces 
- landscape poetry 
- prose poetry 
- profile pieces and articles
- personal essays 
- fictional short stories 

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write? 
I use my laptop mostly but a pen and paper or notes. A calm environment. Which for me includes a tea, a comfortable, light filled space and greenery. I find I am more creative and focused when writing outside under the sky. However, this is limiting becasue of the weather (especially in Melbourne) so I make do with my kitchen table as it is the room that gets the most sun in the house. If writing on the couch which I tend to do a lot, I like a cushion under my laptop and often I play soft instrumental music as a type of white noise element. I tend to write nonsensical dribble for the first paragraph which actually helps me get into the 'zone'. I centre it around the topic I'm focusing on that day. If I'm finding it difficult to get started, I use the pomodoro method to aid in transitioning into that flow state.

### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
The tools I use are more habitual than anything else and help me perosnally get into a flow state. However, I'm not under the impression I have the best process and think I could benefit from exploring other options. 

### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)? 
They help my writing practice as they aid in making me feel comfortable and open up my mind to creative epxression. However that is also in itself a constraint as if they enviroment isn't perfect I can use it as an excuse not to write and feel uncomfortable. However, I think that a lot of it is phsycosomatic and that my writing practice would flourish if I was pushed to write in numerous differnt conditions and circumstances. In relation to digital writing my practice is very physical and analog even when I'm using a laptop. I'm not a confident tech or technological tool user. Which is why this course could aid in the development of new skills and directions in my writing practice.

### Repositories we made in class RE coded peotries. 

[How to make a dadist poem](https://github.com/EmilyyDale/to-make-a-dadaist-poem)

[N plus 7](https://github.com/EmilyyDale/n-plus-7)

### Other Respositories we've made in class. 

These include our kinetic poems, which I found fun and interesting but had difficulty with the coding. Then there's bitsy and inform 7 which were cool applications. I especially enjoyed bitsy hoever, ot was twine that took my fancy more so than vthe others and is the program I settled on to begin developing my project. i would say this is because of the story element which is more ingrained in the twine software. I enjoyed playing the example interactive fictions and choose your own adventure games based on twine which we looked at in class.

## Folio Ideas


### Initial idea... 

I enjoy motorcycles so wanted to create something centred around that theme. I discovered this website where people can upload rides which are presented in the form of lines that appear when you hover over differnt parts of the map. Anyone can add a ride they've done. The website is a really cool way to sahre rides on back roads and interesting routes around the place. 

Here's a link to the site: [Find a Ride] (https://www.motowhere.com/explore/find/Melbourne,+Victoria,+Australia/at/-37.814,144.9633,10)

So my idea was to create a map like this with rides I've been on around Melbourne and Victoria with the same concept where you hover over the map and lines appear showing the ride routs in differnt colours. Then when you click on the ride a poem appears illustrating the themes, routes, ideas around that ride. And the poem would have been a continuous flow - infinitely generated poem. 

However. After consulting my housemate (who codes) we decided it ould be too complicated of a job for me to code myself. So I sadly had to let go of this idea and start on the road to developing a new concept that fits my coding skills. 

### New Idea 

I was going through some old pieces I've written which revolved around the concept of the Hero's Journey. That traditional story flow of the characters starting out, maybe seeking adventure and not happy where they are so they set off for something differnt - to discover change. 

I thought this idea would be easier to play out in a twine - interactive piece. I like the idea of adnenture, catastrophy and an element of the fantastic unknown. 

I'm thinking of choosing to use twine as my platform as, well, firstly it's seems to be the easiest platform to use (haha - my coding skills are so very limited) and I'm thinking it will be the best platform to portray the concept of my proposed piece in an intersting way. 


I've started sketching outthe concept of my story in graphic format and I think I will encorporate these images into my story to add in setting each scene and aiding in the reader's understanding of the story and it's flow. 

### Who is the audience for your developed work? 

My Audience is based around people who enjoy adventure and the unknown. It's a simple story plot so would be aimed at a younger crowd - young adults.

### How does having an audience in mind affect the development of the work? 

Having a particular audience in mind helps to centre the main plot of my work and how I'll go about developing the story. By chosing to relate my piece to an audience of young dults who enjoy reading/playing adventure stories, it helps me define the pirameters of my piece and how far I can take certain themes. 

So, deciding that my audience will be younger adults I can push through elements of self-discovery and self-realisation as well as the complications of friendship and how the differing of opinions and ideas when you're in your pubescent years can put a weight on your friendship, almost and often distroying it.

The voice will be how I relate to this younger audience as well as character ages athe complications of young poeples relationships. 

### Where would you want to publish? And what type of platform would you have in mind? 

Itch.io ? Or a literary journal or Voice works 


### Beginning of Development of work
